# Flutter
## Introduction
Social Media Applications and Dating Apps for seem to take up so much of the modern bachelor or bachelorette. The worse part of this is the fact that you tend to connect your dating application to your favorite social media page. This leads to frustration because both of these applications ask for the same type of information and Flutter aims to change that in several ways.

1. By using one login with Google we cut down on unnecassary additional passwords, usernames and you will never need to worry about any security breaches of Flutter.
2. By combining a Social Media application and a dating application information can easily be transferred between them easily! 

## Instructions For Use

The user will arrive on the login page on arrival where they will be prompted to login with Google. Once logged in with Google they will be brought to a page where they will choose which side of the website to go to. Either the Nest/social media app or the All Birds No Bees/dating app.

On the Nest it functions like your typical social media website. You can create hoots also known as posts, follow people, directly message people also known as chirp, and make groups referred to as flocks. 

On All Birds No Bees the user will be able to visit other users profiles and Rub Beaks or Break their Hearts. They will also be able to answer a question(s) to get to know the other users better and vice versa.

## Contribute

At this point in time the developers are open to outside collaborators on Flutter. That may change in the future as this project grows and scale issues require more skillsets and man-hours to build and maintain the platform.  If you believe in the mission of this product the best thing you can do is utilize the product, contribute code snippets, and help build our knowledgebase.
